Use cased project needs to have:

- Contain functions for all basic math functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Operation will consist of a number - operator - number (1 + 1)
- Create function 'operate' that takes an operator and two numbers and calls the matching function
- Add a clear button/ function
- Create functions that populate the display
- ** Something to note, this isn't going to be like an actual calculator **
- The behavior of multi-number/ multi-operator doesn't follow normal flow/ PEMDAS. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 _ 3 each pair is isolated. 12 + 7 gets evaluated, so its now 19. 19 - 5 is 14. 14 _ 3 is what we are looking for (not the actual answer which is 4) (so anytime an operator is pressed, it should be applied to the previous number)

- Round numbers with long decimals
- Check if user is trying to divide by 0, if so, display message
